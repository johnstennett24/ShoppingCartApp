# Overview
I am trying to learn more about mySQL so that I can build a WebAPI in C# and connect it to a mobile app written in Flutter

I am trying to broaden my skills in Flutter and Dart and making apps in these languages.

This program is written in the Dart programming language.
My purpose for this project is to create a App in Flutter and learn more about the framework.
